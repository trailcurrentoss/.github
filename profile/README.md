# Overview

TrailCurrent is an open-source platform bringing Software Defined Vehicle (SDV) capabilities to a broad range of vehicle types. Leveraging readily available low-cost commodity hardware, we hope to enable all vehicles with intelligence and ongoing improvements via a unified platform and OTA updates.

The initial target for the project is RVs or travel trailers. This is based solely on the opportunity for test vehicles. However, the goal is to expand the platform and provide valuable functionality to all of the following vehicle types:
- Cars, Trucks, and Passenger Vans
- Boats
- Motorcycles
- UTVs and Side-by-Sides
